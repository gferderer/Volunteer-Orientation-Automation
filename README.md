# Volunteer-Orientation-Automation
## Bike Farm Volunteer Orientation Sign-up Automation
### [Bike Farm](http://bikefarm.org/) is an all volunteer-run collective dedicated to every aspect of bicycle education, from safe commuting to repair. 
##### New volunteers can sign-up for our monthly orientation by filling out a Google Form. This google-apps-script sends automated email, personalized with name and selected date, to the attendee. Additionally, it adds the event to their google calendar where they may RSVP and receive a reminder. Bike shops have an unfortunate reputation as intimidating, inaccessible spaces for those with limited background knowledge around bikes. By increasing engagement touch points in this portion of our volunteer onboarding process we hope to make potential volunteers feel welcomed by the community and more likely to show up to orientation. The automation of this task is essential in maintaining our capacity and would not be feasible to do manually.
